Repo for quiz challenge

## Description
The main goal of this challenge is to demonstrate and apply the html, css, and javascript that we have learned so far.
Through completeing this challenge we will be able to demonstrate how to build and edit our own code and apply js to make the quiz interactive.

## Purpose
The purpose is to use our knowledge gained from the previous weeks and apply them to a new project that involves using code that we have created to makeup our own quiz app by building the framework with html and css, and making it interactive using javascript.
- The motivation for this project is to be able to display the ability to follow instructions, implement, and display a working end product.
- This project was created to simulate an on the job experience and deliver a working product for the share holder/employer.
- This project solve issues related to being able to take a starter code and edit into a working product that can be deployed to the customer.
- In this project I learned:
  - How to build a framework for the site utilizing html and css.
  - Utilizing javascript to make the quiz interactive and shuffle through questions so that multiple sets of questions and answers are available to the player.
